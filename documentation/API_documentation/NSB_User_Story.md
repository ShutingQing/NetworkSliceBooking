| ---- | ----- |
| API family name | Network Slicing API |
| API summary | There are emerging requirements in high-rate time-critical applications in the areas of Cloud-gaming, AR/VR, Live Video Streaming, Real-time Multi-Media etc through mobile networks. The on-demand network slicing service technology can provide a network slice reservation method for such scenarios to meet the SLA assurance expected by developers for a specific time period and a dedicated service area.
